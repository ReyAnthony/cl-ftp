* Overview

CL-FTP is a library which provides FTP client functionality to a Common Lisp
program.  CL-FTP uses the USOCKET package for network sockets and the
SPLIT-SEQUENCE package for some parsing needs.

* Examples

#+begin_src lisp
  (with-ftp-connection (conn :hostname "foo")
    (retrieve-file conn "bar" "baz"))
#+end_src

Further examples should be included with your copy of this software.  See
simple-client.lisp for a simple FTP client written with CL-FTP.
